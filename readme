To use btcelib, simply import it to your code:

    import btcelib

Load one of the supported exchange classes:
    kraken = btcelib.Kraken.Kraken()

..and use the available methods to get data from the exchange. i.e.:
    print(kraken.ob('XBTEUR'))

Check the code for documentation; it should be abundantly clear what each function does.
